the difference between an api and sdk is how they are used. 
api alone only describes an interface. think like the buttons you use to interact with a device. 
you have to understand an api and interact with it do stuff but its not the only tool you use. 

however, an sdk or software development kit. would be all the tools you would use to develop/build an application. 
so if they understand techinically all code becomes something called machine code. just a series of 1's and 0's.
well if you have code that interacts with an api. it wont do any good if its still just human readable programming language. 
thats where things called compilers convert to machine code. 
or things like ide(integrated development enviroments) bascially fancy text editors help too as part of an sdk. 
additionally there are things called librarys that have prewritten code that some one can program  with. 
these librarys can be called to due things that are common in writing new applications. 

sdk include not just api but  ide, compilers, build tools, librarys, debuggers, publish tools, general configuration of those other tools for particular projects.
