# You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell represents number of coins in that cell. 
#Assuming we start at matrix[0][0], 
#and can only move right or down, 
#find the maximum number of coins you can collect by the bottom right corner.

# For example, in this matrix

# 0 3 1 1
# 2 0 0 4
# 1 5 3 1
# The most we can collect is 0 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 12 coins.

# this is a branching algorthim. 
# how many possible paths are there in a matrix?
#and how can you reduce the number of paths to look at?
