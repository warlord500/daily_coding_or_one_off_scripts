# This problem was asked by Google.

# Determine whether a doubly linked list is a palindrome. What if itâ€™s singly linked?

# For example, 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 returns True while 1 -> 4 returns False.

# small note this is more pesudo code than anything else.
def isDoubleLinkedAPalindrome(list):
    # the step code could be gotten rid of 
    # then you would have to detect that firstHalf and SecondHalf 
    # are not Null.
    # though in those I dont do null checking because I assume that every single 
    # link beside the last are null. and you dont need to go that far.
